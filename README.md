## Installing from the Chrome Web Store
This extension is available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/who%20-people-picture-downl/neombaabkjophodlnogcgofhfimgegkl).  You can visit this link from either Edge or Chrome to install it as an extension.

## Installing extensions locally
You can add extensions to Edge or Chrome using the files in this repository:

1. Download the latest .zip file found in the [dist](https://github.com/mattl-msft/Who-Plus-People-Picture-Downloader/tree/main/dist) folder.
2. Create a new folder on your computer, and extract the files from the .zip to your new folder (remember its name and location).
3. Go to your browser's extension manager
   * **Edge**: go to '...' menu, then Extensions
   * **Chrome**: go to '...' menu, then More Tools > Extensions
  

4. Select "Load unpacked" and select the new folder you created earlier.

You'll then be able to use this extension based on the local files you've downloaded. If you use local versions of extensions this way, they will **not** receive future bug fixes or updates, so this method is not recommended if an extension is available in the Web Store.
