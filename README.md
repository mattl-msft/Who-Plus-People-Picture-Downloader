## Installing from the Chrome Web Store
This extension has been submitted to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions),
 and is undergoing the approval process.  Stay tuned for the direct link...

## Installing extensions locally
You can add extensions to Edge or Chrome using the files in this repository:

1. Download the [version 1.1 .zip file](https://github.com/mattl-msft/Who-Plus-People-Picture-Downloader/raw/main/dist/Who-Plus-People-Picture-Downloader-v1.1.zip) (found in the [dist](https://github.com/mattl-msft/Who-Plus-People-Picture-Downloader/tree/main/dist) folder).
2. Create a new folder on your computer, and extract the files from the .zip to your new folder (remember its name and location).
3. Go to your browser's extension manager
   * **Edge**: go to '...' menu, then Extensions
   * **Chrome**: go to '...' menu, then More Tools > Extensions
  

4. Select "Load unpacked" and select the new folder you created earlier.

You'll then be able to use this extension based on the local files you've downloaded.  This is a good stop-gap measure if you want to use the extension before it gets accepted to the Web Store.  If you use local versions of extensions this way, they will **not** receive future bug fixes or updates, so this method is not recommended if an extension is available in the Web Store.
